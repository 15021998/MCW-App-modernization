## Abstract and learning objectives 

Modernize legacy on-premise applications and infrastructure by leveraging several cloud services, while adding a mix of web and mobile services, all secured using AAD.

Learning Objectives:

-   Use Azure App Services

-   Protect app secrets using Key Vault

-   Empower business users to create ad-hoc CRUD mobile apps with PowerApps

-   Centralize authorization across Azure services using AAD

-   Orchestrate between services such as Office 365 email and mobile using Flow

-   Use Search to make files full text searchable

## Overview

The App Modernization hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and search, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

After lawyers affirmed that Contoso Ltd. could legally store customer data in the cloud, Contoso created a strategy that capitalized on the capabilities of Microsoft Azure.

![The Solution architecture is described in the following text.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture")

The solution begins with mobile apps (built for Android and iOS using **Xamarin**) and a website, both of which provide access to PolicyConnect. The website, hosted in a **Web App**, provides the user interface for browser-based clients, whereas the Xamarin Forms-based apps provide the UI to mobile devices. Both mobile app and website rely on web services hosted in an **API App**. Sensitive configuration data like connection strings are stored in **Key Vault** and accessed from the API App or Web App on demand so that these settings never live in their file system. Full-text search of policy documents is enabled by the Indexer for **Blob Storage** (which indexes text in the Word and PDF documents) and stores the results in an **Azure Search** index. **PowerApps** enable authorized business users to build mobile and web create, read, update, delete (CRUD) applications that interact with **SQL Database** and Azure Storage, while **Microsoft Flow** enables them to orchestrations between services such as Office 365 email and services for sending mobile notifications. These orchestrations can be used independently of PowerApps or invoked by PowerApps to provide additional logic. The solution uses user and application identities maintained in **Azure Active Directory**.

### Task 1: Create web app, SQL database, and storage instances and migrate SQL

In this exercise, you will provision a website via the Azure Web App template using the Microsoft Azure Portal. You will then provision storage instances for storing the PDF files. Next, you will migrate the on-premises SQL database to new Azure SQL instance you created.

### Subtask 1: Create the web app instance

1.  From the Azure Management portal <http://portal.azure.com>, using a new tab or instance, navigate to create a new **Web App**

2.  Click **New**, and in the Marketplace search text box enter **Web App**. Click the **Web App** item in the search results.

    ![In the Azure Portal New blade, Web App is typed in the search field.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image27.png "Azure Portal, New blade")

3.  On the **Everything** blade, select **Web App**

    ![In the Everything blade, Web App is selected in the Results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image28.png "Everything blade")

4.  Click **Create** on the Web App blade![Screenshot of the Web App blade with the Create button selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image29.png "Web App blade")

5.  On the **Web App** blade, specify the following configuration:

    -   Enter a unique and valid URL (until the green check mark appears) in the App Name field.

    -   Leave Subscription to the default value.

    -   Under Resource group, click the Use existing radio button, and select the **ContosoInsuranceHackathon** resource group.
        ![Fields in the Web App blade are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image30.png "Web App blade")

    -   Click on the arrow in the App Service Plan/Location.

    -   On the App Service Plan blade, and click Create New.
        
        ![Create new is selected in the App Service plan blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image31.png "App Service plan blade")

        i.  Enter **ContosoInsurancePlan** into the App Service plan textbox.

        ii. For Location, select the same region as the **ContosoInsuranceHackathon** resource group.

        iii. Leave the Pricing tier as the default value, **S1 Standard**.
        
        ![In the New App Service plan blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image32.png "New App Service plan blade")

6.  Click **OK** to save the configuration.

    ![Screenshot of the OK button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image33.png "OK button")

7.  Click **Create** to finish the creation of the Web App.

    ![Screenshot of the Create button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image34.png "Create button")

8.  Make a note of the Web Application name and save for later.

### Subtask 2: Create the SQL server instance

We will not create the databases at this time, since it will be created during the database migration step.

1.  From the Azure Management portal <http://portal.azure.com>, using a new tab or instance, navigate to create **SQL server (logical server)**.

2.  Click **New**, and in the Marketplace search text box enter **SQL server**. Click the **SQL server (logical server)** item in the search results.

    ![the search field in the New blade is set to SQL Server (logical server).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image35.png "New blade")

3.  On the **Everything** blade, select **SQL server (logical server)**.

    ![In the Everything blade search results, SQL server (logical server) is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image36.png "Everything blade search results")

4.  Click **Create**

    ![The Create button is selected in the SQL server (logical server) blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image37.png "SQL server (logical server) blade")

5.  On the **SQL server (logical server)** blade, specify the following configuration:

    -   Server name: a unique value (ensure the green checkmark appears)

    -   Server admin login: **demouser**

    -   **Password** and **Confirm Password**: demo\@pass123

    -   Under Resource group, click the Use existing radio button, and specify the **ContosoInsuranceHackathon** resource group

    -   Ensure the **Location** is the same region as the web app

        ![Fields in the SQL Server blade are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image38.png "SQL Server blade")

6.  Once the values are accepted in the **SQL Server (logical server)** blade, check the Pin to dashboard checkbox, and click **Create**

    ![Screenshot of the Pin to dashboard checkbox.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image39.png "Pin to dashboard checkbox")

7.  After the SQL Server is provisioned, browse the list of services from the portal navigation pane, and select**SQL servers** underneath DATABASES. Click the name of the SQL Server you just created.

    ![In the Azure Portal, More services is selected. Under Databases, SQL servers is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image40.png "Azure Portal")

    ![The SQL Server name contoso-insurance-srv is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image41.png "SQL Server name")

8.  On the **SQL Server** blade click **Firewall / Virtual Networks** under Settings

9.  On the **Firewall / Virtual Networks** blade, specify a new rule named **ALL**, with START IP **0.0.0.0**, and END IP **255.255.255.255**

    ![On the SQL Server blade, under Settings, Firewall / Virtual Networks is selected. New rule fields are populated with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image42.png "SQL Server blade")
    
**Note**: Adding all IP address ranges as shown here is done for simplicity's sake for this hands-on lab, and is **not recommended** in other cases. The correct approach is to add only the necessary IPs and consider limiting access to Azure SQL through AAD ( <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication> )

10. Click **Save**

    ![Screenshot of the Save button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image43.png "Save button")

    ![Screenshot of the API App blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image52.png "API App blade")

4.  On the Create API App blade, specify the following configuration options:

    -   Name: unique value for the App name (ensure the green check\
        mark appears)

    -   Specify the Resource Group **ContosoInsuranceHackathon**

    -   Select the **ContosoInsurancePlan** App Service plan, created previously

        ![The Create API App blade fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image53.png "Create API App blade")

5.  Click **Create**.

    ![Screenshot of the Create button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image47.png "Create button")

6.  Make a note of the Web API name and save for later

### Subtask 5: Migrate the on-premises SQL database to Azure

1.  From your VM, click on Start and then type SQL Server to select **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** (SSMS)

1.  Once SSMS launches log in to your local SQL Express instance and expand the **Databases** node on the left-hand menu. Right-click on the **ContosoInsurance** database, and select **Tasks Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure SQL Database...**
    
    ![In SQL Express, Databases is expanded and ContosoInsurance is selected. From its right-click menu, Tasks / Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure SQL Database is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image54.png "SQL Express ")

3.  A dialog window named "Deploy Database 'ContosoInsurance'" will appear. Click **Next** to begin

4.  Within the Deployment Settings section, click on the **Connect** button next to the Server connection box\
    ![On the Deployment Settings page, the Connect button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image55.png "Deployment Settings page")

5.  In the SQL Server connection dialog box, enter the Azure SQL server name you created in while provisioning the server. If in doubt, you can refer to the server name from your resources list in Azure.

    -   Enter the username: **demouser**

    -   Enter the password you created: **demo\@pass123**

        ![Screenshot of the Connect to Server dialog box with fields displaying the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image56.png "Connect to Server dialog box")

    -   Click **Connect**

6.  You should now see the Azure SQL server name in the Server connection box. Verify the new database name is **ContosoInsurance** and click **Next**
    
    ![Screenshot of the Deployment Settings page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image57.png "Deployment Settings page")

7.  Verify the specified settings are correct, and click **Finish**

8.  Once the operation has completed, close the database deployment dialog. You should see green checkmarks next to each completed step, along with a large checkmark next to "Operation Complete."

    ![The Results page displays with the Operation Complete message. A summary of deployment steps displays with the result of success.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image58.png "Results page")
    
**Note**: If you receive an error during the import stage similar to the following, you need to make sure you are using the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio. This error can be caused by newer Azure SQL compatibility levels not being supported by older versions of SSMS, or if you did not set your SQL Server firewall settings:

    "Unable to connect to master or target server \'ContosoInsurance\'. You must have a user with the same password in master or target server \'ContosoInsurance\'."

9.  Verify that the database is operational, and its tables populated by connecting to it through SSMS, using the same credentials used in Step 5 above

10. Go back to the Azure Portal, and then find the ContosoInsurance database that was created during the migration, by going to **Browse, SQL databases.** Click on **ContosoInsurance** to open a blade for the database.
    \
    ![In the SQL databases blade, ContosoInsurance is selected in the search results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image59.png "SQL databases blade")

11. Click on **Show database connection strings**, and click the **copy** button next to the ADO.NET connection string. Save the connection string for later.
    
    ![In the ContosoInsurance blade, the Connection strings (Show database connection strings) link is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image60.png "ContosoInsurance blade")

## Exercise 2: Identity and security

Duration: 30 minutes

Azure Active Directory will be used to allow users to authenticate to the web app, PolicyConnect desktop app, mobile apps, and PowerApps solutions. Azure AD will also be used to manage application access to Key Vault secrets. You have been asked to create a new Azure AD Tenant and secure the application so only users from the tenant can log on.

13. Click **Save**.

### Task 3: Expose Web API to other applications 

In order to make the Web API accessible to other applications added to Azure Active Directory, we must define the appropriate permissions. We will modify the manifest for the Web API to configure these settings, since, as of now, the Azure management portal does not provide an interface for this.

1.  Within the Azure Active Directory blade, click **App registrations**, and select your Web API application.

    ![In the Azure Active Directory Blade, under Manage, App registrations is selected. Under Display Name, Contoso Insurance Web app / API is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image82.png "Azure Active Directory Blade")

2.  In the Web API blade, click **Manifest**.
    
    ![The manifest button is selected in the Contoso Insurance Web API blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image83.png "Contoso Insurance Web API blade")

3.  In the Edit manifest blade, look for the **oauth2AllowImplicitFlow** setting. Change the value to **true**. This is required for our javascript Web API service calls from the web application. 

    ![In the Edit manifest blade, oauth2AllowImplicitFlow is called out, and is set to True.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image84.png "Edit manifest blade")

4.  Look for the **oauth2Permissions** setting. Either this will be pre-populated with a value, or it will be empty.

    Pre-populated:
    
    ![The oauthPermissions setting has : \[ .](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image85.png "oauthPermissions setting")\
    
    Empty:
    
    ![The oauthPermissions setting is empty](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image86.png "oauthPermissions setting")
    
    We need to add **one new permission** to this array (copy the text below and replace the id value):
    ```
    {

    "adminConsentDescription": "Allow read-write access to the Contoso Insurance Web API on behalf of the signed-in user",

    "adminConsentDisplayName": "Read-Write access to Contoso Insurance Web API",

    "id": "**494581dd-4bf5-451d-9bf8-487f4a43a09c**",

    "isEnabled": true,

    "type": "User",

    "userConsentDescription": "Allow read-write access to the Contoso Insurance Web API on your behalf",

    "userConsentDisplayName": "Read-Write access to Contoso Insurance Web API",

    "value": "Read_Write_ContosoInsurance_WebAPI"

    }
    ```

    Make sure that you enter a new, generated Guid into the **id** property (in bold above). You can generate a new Guid by opening PowerShell and running the following command:\
    ```
    [guid]::NewGuid()
    ```

    The final result should look like this: 
    
    ![The Edit Manifest blade code window displays with a block of code selected. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the code window. Future versions of this course should address this.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image87.png "Edit Manifest blade code window")

## Exercise 3: Configure blob storage and search indexing

Duration: 30 minutes

Contoso Insurance is currently storing all of their scanned PDF documents on a local network share. They have asked to enable full-text searching on the documents, and to be able to store them automatically from a workflow. We have already provisioned a storage instance that we will use to store the files in a blob container. First, we need a way to bulk upload their existing PDFs, then configure search indexing on that container.

9.  Browse to the AzCopy directory. By default, it is installed to %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\AzCopy (64-bit Windows) or %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\AzCopy (32-bit Windows).

10. Type in the following command, replacing the **bold** values with your own:\
    
    ```
    AzCopy /Source:**C:\\Hackathon\\Files** /Dest:**https://contosoinsurancestorage1.blob.core.windows.net/policies** /DestKey:**DaINeh6zmORuR+OOMDoG7SmtQSiJznk75hqFlB9b0kUVgyobb7y1Txzb1iQGjvdFDsgxLQtgVMBPy0h5ZEaHOw==** /S\
    ```

    The **Source** value is the current location of the PDF files. The **Dest** value is the URL for the blob container you copied on step 6. The **DestKey** is the blob storage Account Key you saved after creating the storage account. If you cannot find it, go to Access keys after opening your storage account on the new portal. Copy either key1 or key2.

## Exercise 4: Configure Key Vault

Duration: 15 minutes

Key Vault will be used to protect sensitive information, such as database connection strings and storage account keys. Our application services that we have registered within Azure Active Directory will be granted access to the Key Vault secrets we create in this section. We have selected to use secrets instead of keys, due to the small size of the strings we are storing, as well as how often we need to retrieve the values. Retrieving secrets from Key Vault is a lower latency operation than retrieving keys, due to the real-time encryption and decryption involved.

### Help references

| Use Azure Key Vault from a Web Application | <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/key-vault-use-from-web-application/> |


### Task 1: Create a new Key Vault 

1.  Launch **PowerShell** from the Start Menu

2.  Within PowerShell type in the login command for Azure:\
    Login-AzureRmAccount

3.  You will be prompted to log in with your Azure credentials. Be sure to sign in with the same Azure account you have been using throughout the hackathon.

4.  If you have multiple subscriptions and want to specify a specific one to use for Azure Key Vault, type the following to see the subscriptions for your account:

    ```
    Get-AzureRmSubscription
    ```

    Then to specify the correct subscription to use, type:
    
    ```
    Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <subscription Id>
    ```

5.  Use the New-AzureRmKeyVault cmdlet to create your key vault. Enter a name for your vault, such as **ContosoInsuranceKeyVault** (the name needs to be unique; you may need to try different values if the below script fails). Enter the Resource Group name you created earlier, such as **ContosoInsuranceHackathon**. Be sure to enter the same region as your other services, such as **westus**:\
    
    ```
    New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName 'ContosoInsuranceKeyVault' -ResourceGroupName 'ContosoInsuranceHackathon' -Location 'westus'
    ```

**Note**: Perform the following if you receive the following error when attempting to create the Key Vault:\
    New-AzureRmKeyVault : Could not load file or assembly \'Microsoft.Data.Services.Client, Version=5.6.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
    
    Open PowerShell as an Administrator, then execute the following:
    
    ```
    Install-Module AzureRM -AllowClobber
    ```

6.  After the vault has been created, make note of the **Vault URI** for later:
    
    ![In the PowerShell window, the vault URI is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image136.png "PowerShell window")

### Task 2: Create a new secret to store the SQL connection string 

1.  Now we will add a secret to the vault for our ContosoInsurance database connection string. Within the PowerShell window, convert the database connection string to a secure string by typing in the following ***(make sure to add in your SQL server username and password to the connection string first!):
    
    ```
    $secretvalue = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Server=tcp:**contoso-insurance-serv**.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=ContosoInsurance;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=**demouser**;Password=**demo@pass123**;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;' -AsPlainText -Force
    ```

    Now type in the following, ***making sure to use your correct Vault Name***:
    
    ```
    $secret = Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName **'ContosoInsuranceKeyVault'** -Name **'SQLConnectionString'** -SecretValue $secretvalue
    ```

2.  Obtain the URI for your new secret, and save it for later. This will be used for the **SecretUri** application settings value:\
    \$secret.Id\
    \
    You can use this URI to reference your SQLConnectionString secret from your applications. Use the URI, omitting the version number after "SQLConnectionString/", in order to always obtain the latest version of the secret. Example: <https://contosoinsurancekeyvault.vault.azure.net:443/secrets/SQLConnectionString/>

3.  We need to grant the Web API application access to the secret we just created. Refer to the Client (Application) Id you saved when adding the Web API to Azure AD. If in doubt, you can find it by going to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com), selecting your Azure Active Directory instance, going to the App Registrations tab, selecting the Web API application entry, and clicking on Properties under General.
    \
    Within PowerShell, type in the following command, replacing the \<Client Id\> value with your own:\

    ```
    Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName 'ContosoInsuranceKeyVault' -ServicePrincipalName **<Client Id>** -PermissionsToSecrets Get
    ```

    ![The previously defined command displays in the PowerShell window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image137.png "PowerShell window")

### Task 3: Add Client Id, Client Secret, and Secret URL to Web API's app settings 

To allow the Web API to access the Key Vault secret, we must add the Azure AD Client Id for the Web API app, along with the Client Secret and the Secret URL to the application settings on its app service instance.

1.  Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure Management portal, <http://portal.azure.com>

1.  Click on **App Services** in the left-hand menu, and click on the **Contoso Insurance Web API** instance within the App Services list.
    
    ![In the App Services blade, ContosoInsuranceWebAPI is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image138.png "App Services blade")

3.  Click on **Application Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Application settings button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image139.png "Application settings button")

4.  Scroll down to the **App settings** section, and create the following Key / Value pairs (the key names must exactly match those found in the Web.config file for the Contoso.Apps.Insurance.WebAPI project in Visual Studio):

    -   Key: **ClientId** Value: \<AAD web app Client Id for Web API\>

    -   Key: **ClientSecret** Value: \<AAD web app Key for Web API\>

    -   Key: **SecretUri** Value \<Key Vault Uri for the SQLConnectionString secret\>

        Make sure that you exactly match the Key names to the App Settings keys in the Web.config file, including proper casing.
        
        ![The previously mentioned key / value pairs display under App settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image140.png "App settings section")

5.  Click **Save**.

## Exercise 5: Configure and deploy the Contoso Insurance apps

Duration: 40 minutes

The developers at Contoso Insurance have been working toward migrating their apps to the cloud. As such, most of the pieces are already in place to deploy the apps to Azure, as well as configure them to communicate with the new app services, such as Web API. Since the required services have already been provisioned on Azure up to this point, what remains is applying application-level configuration settings, and then deploying any hosted apps and services from the Visual Studio Starter Project solution.

### Task 1: Deploy the Web API

In this exercise, the attendee will apply application settings using the Microsoft Azure Portal. The attendee will then deploy the Web API from the Starter Project.

### Subtask 1: Configure application settings in Azure 

1.  Navigate to the **Contoso.Apps.Insurance.WebAPI** project located in the **Web** folder using the **Solution Explorer** of Visual Studio.
    
    ![In Solution Explorer, the Web folder is expanded, and contoso.Apps.Insurance.WebAPI i s called out. Under this, Web.config is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image141.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

2.  Open **Web.config** to use the **appSettings** keys as a reference. Instead of updating the application settings in the config file, we are setting them in the application service for Web API in the portal as an added security measure. If you would like to debug locally, you may place the values in the Web.config file as well.
    
    ![Screenshot of a Code window. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the code window. Future versions of this course should address this.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image142.png "Code window")

    ![In the App Services blade search results, ContosoInsuranceWebAPI is selected. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image138.png "App Services blade")

5.  Click on **Application Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Application settings button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image139.png "Application settings button")

6.  Scroll down to the **App settings** section. You should already have the Key / Value pairs that were created in the previous exercise for ClientId, ClientSecret, and SecretUri. Create the following additional Key / Value pairs (the key names must exactly match those found in the Web.config file for the Contoso.Apps.Insurance.WebAPI project in Visual Studio):

    -   Key: **ida:Tenant** Value: \<AAD tenant name\>

    -   Key: **ida:Audience** Value: \<App ID URI within AAD application settings\>\
        
        The **ida:Tenant** value is your Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant name (e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com), which can be found by selecting Custom Domain Names within Azure Active Directory on the portal.

    The **ida:Audience** value is the App ID URI from the Azure portal within the AAD application settings for this Web API.

7.  Make sure that you exactly match the Key names to the App Settings keys in the Web.config file, including proper casing.

8.  Click **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Save button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image143.png "Save button")

    ![A list of Policy types and the number of policy holders for each displays in the Manage Policy Holders webpage.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image161.png "Manage Policy Holders webpage")

### Task 3: Configure and run the legacy desktop (Windows Forms) application

Contoso Insurance has created a web and mobile version of their desktop application, but they have opted to update it to communicate with the new Web API service for business and data functionality, doing away with their old WCF services (also included in the solution). They have also replaced their SQL membership-based user authentication with Azure Active Directory (AAD).

If you would like to run the desktop application in its original configuration, make sure you have set up your local self-signed certificates, as outlined in Exercise 1, Task 5. Also, make sure that you run both WCF services when debugging the desktop application by right clicking on the Solution, and clicking on Select StartUp Projects... From here, select the Multiple startup projects radio button, and selectthe Start action for the following projects, moving them from top to bottom in this order: PolicyConnectDataService, PolicyConnectManagementService, and PolicyConnectDesktop. Also, make sure that the UseWebApi app setting is set to false in App.config.

In this exercise, the attendee will update the application settings in the App.config file, allowing the desktop application's updated code to take advantage of the new Azure services.

### Subtask 1: Configure application settings in App.config 

1.  Navigate to the **PolicyConnectDesktop** project located in the **Desktop** folder using the **Solution Explorer** of Visual Studio, and open the **App.config** file.
    
    ![In Solution Explorer, the Desktop folder is expanded and PolicyConnectDesktop is selected. Under this, App.config is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Appmodernizationimages/media/image162.png "Solution Explorer")

2.  Scroll down to the **appSettings** section and modify the values for the following keys:\
    \
    The **PdfRootPath** is the root folder of the Pdf files. The path should point to the Files folder within the Hackathon directory you created at the beginning of this hackathon (e.g. C:\\Hackathon\\Files\\).
    \
    The **RootWebApiPath** value is the URL to the published Web API, such as http://contosoinsurancewebapi.azurewebsites.net/\
    \
    **UseWebApi** needs to be set to **true** in order to communicate with the new Web API, and authenticate through AAD instead of the old method.
    \
    The **DesktopClientId** value is the Application Id in Guid format from the Azure Active Directory application settings for this desktop application.
    \
    The **DesktopRedirectUri** value is also from the AAD application setting for this desktop application, named *Redirect URIs*.
    \
    The **WebApiAppId** value is from the Azure Active Directory application settings for the Web API, under Properties, named APP ID URI.

    The **AzureADLoginUrl** is the URL of your Azure Active Directory tenant, which should be: https://login.windows.net/\<tenantID\>. You can find your Tenant Id by opening Azure Active Directory in the portal followed by selecting Properties. The Tenant Id is the Directory ID value.
    \
    The **AzureADTenantId** is the Guid value of your tenant, which was applied to the AzureADLoginUrl key above.

### Subtask 2: Running the desktop application 

1.  Navigate to the **PolicyConnectDesktop** project located in the **Desktop** folder using the **Solution Explorer** of Visual Studio, and right-click on the project.

    \
    The **WebApiAppId** value is from the Azure Active Directory application settings for the Web API, under Properties, named APP ID URI.
    \
    The **WebApiReplyUrl** is retrieved from the AAD application settings for the Web API, under single sign-on. It is the REPLY URL.
    \
    The **AzureADLoginUrl** is the URL of your Azure Active Directory tenant, which should be: https://login.windows.net/\<tenantID\>. You can find your Tenant Id by opening Azure Active Directory in the portal followed by selecting Properties. The Tenant Id is the Directory ID value.
    \
    **GraphResourceUri** should be set to https://graph.windows.net.
    \
    The **AzureADTenantId** is the Guid value of your tenant, which was applied to the AzureADLoginUrl key above.
    \
    To find the **AzureSearchServiceUrl** value, go to Azure and select your search service, then the \"policies\" index, and then \"Search explorer." Copy the full URL within the URL field. Make sure to include the entire path, even the \"&search=\*\" at the end. For example: https://contosoinsurance.search.windows.net/indexes/policies/docs?api-version=2015-02-28&search=\*\
    \
