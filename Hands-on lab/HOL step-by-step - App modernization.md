## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement the steps to modernize a legacy on-premises application, including upgrading and migrating the application and the database to Azure and updating the application to take advantage of serverless and cloud services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, your ability to build solutions for modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure using cloud services will be improved.

## Overview

Parts Unlimited has a hosted web application on its internal infrastructure by using a serves running Windows Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), and Microsoft SQL Server. Beyond the initial effort and costs, these applications incur ongoing maintenance costs in hardware, operating system updates, and licensing fees. These maintenance costs make Microsoft Azure App Service an attractive alternative. Parts Unlimited is looking for migrating Microsoft ASP.NET applications and any associated SQL Server database to Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database. 

> **Note:** The solution provided is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription
- Github account.
- A virtual machine configured with Visual Studio Community 2019 or higher (setup in the Before the hands-on lab exercises)
- **IMPORTANT**: To complete this lab, you must have sufficient rights within your Azure AD tenant to:
  - Create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal
  - Assign roles on your subscription
  - Register resource providers
  
## Exercise 1: Setting Up Azure Migrate

Duration: 10 minutes

Azure Migrate provides a centralized hub to assess and migrate on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data to Azure . It provides a single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure. Azure Migrate comes with a range of tools for assessment and migration that we will use during our lab. We will use Azure Migrate as the central location for our assessment and migration efforts.

## Exercise 2: Migrate Your Application With App Service Migration Assistant

Duration: 15 minutes

The first step for Parts Unlimited is to assess whether their apps have dependencies on unsupported features on Azure App Service. In this exercise, you use an **Azure Migrate** tool called the [App Service migration assistant](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/) to evaluate Parts Unlimited's web site for a migration to Azure App Service. The assessment runs readiness checks and provides potential remediation steps for common issues. Once the assessment succeeds, we will proceed with the migration as well. You will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted in virtual machines running on Azure.

### Task 1: Perform Assessment for Migration to Azure App Service

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their application to Azure App Service. You will use the [App Service migration assistant](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/) to assess the application and run various readiness checks.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **WebVM** VM by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **WebVM** VM from the list of resources.

![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/webvm-selection.png)

2. On the WebVM Virtual Machine's **Overview** blade, select **Connect (1)** and **RDP (2)** on the top menu.

## Exercise 3: Migrate the On-Premises Database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 50 minutes

The next step of Part Unlimited's migration project is the assessment and migration of its database. Currently, the database lives on a SQL Server 2008 R2 on a virtual machine. You will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** tool called **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database for a migration to Azure SQL Database. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and Azure SQL Database. After the assessment, you will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Migration** service called **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**. During the exercise, you will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted in virtual machines running on Azure.

### Task 1: Perform Assessment for Migration to Azure SQL Database

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database. In this task, you will use the [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-2017) (DMA) to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). Data Migration Assistant (DMA) enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. It recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

> **Note**: The Database Migration Assistant is already installed on your SqlServer2008 VM. It can be downloaded through Azure Migrate or from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090807) as well.

1. Connect to your SqlServer2008 VM with RDP. Your credentials are the same as the WebVM.

   ![The SQLServer2008 virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/find-sqlserver2008-resource.png)


2. Launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

> **Note**: There is a known issue with screen resolution when using an RDP connection to Windows Server 2008 R2, which may affect some users. This issue presents itself as very small, hard to read text on the screen. The workaround for this is to use a second monitor for the RDP display, which should allow you to scale up the resolution to make the text larger.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

## Exercise 4: Setup CI/CD Pipeline With GitHub Actions for the Web App

Duration: {TODO}} minutes

In this exercise, you will move the codebase to a Github Repo, create a staging environment in Azure App Service using App Service Deployment Slots, and finally connect the pieces with a CI/CD Pipeline built on Github Actions. 

### Task 1: Moving the Codebase to a GitHub Repo

1. Login to [Github](https://github.com) with your account. Select the New button positioned on top of the repositories list. As an alernative you can [navigate to the new repo site here](https://github.com/new).

    ![Github.com Landing page is shown. New button to create a new repo is highlighted.](media/github-new-repo.png)
    
2. Type in `partsunlimited` **(1)** as your repository name. Select **Private (2)** to prevent public access to the repository. Select **Create repository (3)** to continue.

    ![Repository name is set to partsunlimited. Private access is selected. Create repository button is highlighted.](media/github-partsunlimited-repo.png)
    
3. Select the **clipboard copy command** to copy the Git endpoint for your repo and paste the value into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, for later reference.

    ![Github repo page is shown. Endpoint copy to clipboard button is highlighted.](media/github-endpoint-copy.png)

So far, we have used the WebVM virtual machine to simulate Parts Unlimited's On-Premises IIS server. Now that we are done with the migration of Parts Unlimited's web site. We will use the VM to execute some development tasks. 
    
4. Connect to your WebVM VM with RDP. 

   ![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/webvm-selection.png)
    
5. Right-click on the Windows Start Menu and select **Windows Powershell (Admin)** to launch a terminal window.

    ![Start Menu context menu is open. Windows Powershell (Admin) command is highlighted.](media/launch-powershell.png)

6. The Parts Unlimited website's source code is already copied into the VM as part of the **Before the hands-on lab exercises**. Run the command below to navigate to the source code folder.

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src"
    ```

6. Run the following command to initialize a local Git repo.

    ```powershell
    git init
    ```

    ![Powershell terminal is shown. Git init is highlighted and executed. ](media/git-init.png)

7. Next, we will define the remote endpoint as an origin to our local repository. Replace `{YourEndpointURL}` with the endpoint URL you copied previously from Github. Run the final command in your Powershell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git remote add origin {YourEndpointURL}
    ```
    
    ![Powershell terminal is shown. Git remote add origin is highlighted and executed. ](media/git-remote-add.png)

8. Run the following commands to rename current branch to **Main** and add stage all the files for a git commit.

    ```powershell
    git branch -M main
    git add .
    ```
    
9. Before we commit our changes, we have to identify our git user name and e-mail. In the following command, replace `John Doe` with your name and `johndoe@example.com` with your e-mail address. Once ready, run the command in your Powershell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```

10. We are ready to commit the source code to our local Git repository. Run the following command to continue.

    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    ```

11. Let's push our code to Github. Run the following command in your Powershell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git push -u origin main
    ```

12. Github authentication screen will pop up. Select **Sign in with your browser (2)**. A new browser pop-up will appear with the Github login page.

    ![Powershell terminal shows git push command and the Github Sign In experoence. Sign in with your browser button is highlighted.](media/github-sign-in.png)

13. Fill-in your Github account credentials on the browser window to Sign-In.

14. On the **Authorize Git Credential Manager** screen select **Authorize GotCredentialManager**. This will give your local environment permission to push the code to Github.

    ![Authorize Git Credential Manager is open. Authorize GotCredentialManager buttin is highligted.](media/github-access.png)
    
15. Close the browser.

16. Go back to Github and observe the repo with the source code uploaded.
