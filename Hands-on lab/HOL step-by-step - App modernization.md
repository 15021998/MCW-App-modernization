# App modernization hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement the steps to modernize a legacy on-premises application, including upgrading and migrating the database to Azure and updating the application to take advantage of serverless and cloud services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build solutions for modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure using cloud services.

## Overview

Contoso, Ltd. (Contoso) is a new company in an old business. Founded in Auckland, NZ, in 2014, they provide a full range of long-term insurance services to help individuals who are under-insured, filling a void their founders saw in the market. From the beginning, they grew faster than anticipated and have struggled to cope with rapid growth. During their first year alone, they added over 100 new employees to keep up with the demand for their services. To manage policies and associated documentation, they use a custom developed Windows Forms application, called PolicyConnect. PolicyConnect uses an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database as its data store, along with a file server on their local area network for storing policy documents. That application and its underlying processes for managing policies have become increasingly overloaded.

To allow policyholders, brokers and employees to access policy information without requiring them to VPN into the Contoso network, they recently launched projects to create new web and mobile applications. For the web application, they have created a new .NET Core 2.2 MVC web application, which accesses the PolicyConnect database using REST APIs. They eventually intend to have the REST APIs be shared across all of their applications, including the mobile application and WinForms version of PolicyConnect. They have a prototype of the web application running on-premises, and are interested in taking their modernization efforts a step further by hosting the application in the cloud. However, they don't know how to really take advantage of all the managed services of the cloud since they have no experience with it and would like to know how to take what they've created so far and make it more cloud-native.

They have not started development of a mobile app yet, and are looking for guidance on how they can take a .NET developer-friendly approach to implement the PolicyConnect mobile app on Android and iOS.

To prepare for hosting their applications in the cloud, they would like to migrate their SQL Server database to a PaaS SQL service in Azure. Contoso would like to migrate their new web application to the cloud,and optimize that application to run in the cloud, including taking advantage of serverless technologies and advanced security features available in a fully-managed SQL service in the Azure. By migrating to the cloud, they hope to improve their technological capabilities and take advantage of enhancements and services that are enabled by moving to the cloud, including adding automated document forwarding from brokers, securing access for brokers to Contoso, allowing access to policy information, and providing easy policy retrieval for a dispersed workforce. They have been clear that they will continue using the PolicyConnect WinForms application on-premises, but want to update the application to use cloud-based APIs and services. Additionally, they want to store policy documents in cloud storage for retrieval via the web and mobile applications.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes...](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with migrating Contoso's SQL Server 2008 R2 database to Azure SQL Database using the Azure Database Migration Service. After performing an assessment using the Data Migration Assistant, Contoso was able to determine that there were no compatibility issues or unsupported features to prevent them from migrating into a fully-managed SQL database service in Azure. Next, the web and API apps are migrated into Azure App Services. In addition, mobile apps, built for Android and iOS using Xamarin, are created to provide access to PolicyConnect. The website, hosted in a Web App, provides the user interface for browser-based clients, whereas the Xamarin Forms-based apps provide the UI to mobile devices. Both the mobile app and website rely on web services hosted in an a Function App, which sits behind API Management. An API App is also deployed to host APIs for the legacy Windows Forms desktop application. Light-weight, serverless APIs are provided by Azure Functions and Azure Functions Proxies to provide access to the database and policy documents stored in Blob Storage. Azure API Management is used to create an API Store for development teams and affiliated partners. Sensitive configuration data, like connection strings, are stored in Key Vault and accessed from the APIs or Web App on demand so that these settings never live in their file system. The API App uses the Azure Redis Cache to implement the cache aside pattern, caching data as it is retrieved from SQL Database. A full-text cognitive search pipeline is used to index policy documents in Blob Storage. Cognitive Services are used to enable search index enrichment using cognitive skills in Azure Search. PowerApps enable authorized business users to build mobile and web create, read, update, delete (CRUD) applications that interact with SQL Database and Azure Storage, while Microsoft Flow enables them to orchestrations between services such as Office 365 email and services for sending mobile notifications. These orchestrations can be used independently of PowerApps or invoked by PowerApps to provide additional logic. The solution uses user and application identities maintained in Azure AD.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
  - Rights to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription.
- A virtual machine configured with Visual Studio Community 2019 or higher (setup in the Before the hands-on lab exercises)

## Exercise 1: Migrate the on-premises database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 40 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform an assessment on the `ContosoInsurance` database for a migration to Azure SQL Database. The assessment will provide a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB.

> DMA helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server. To learn more, read the [Data Migration Assistant documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=azuresqldb-mi-current).

### Task 1: Restore and configure the ContosoInsurance database on the SqlServer2008 VM

Before you begin the assessment, you need to restore a copy of the `ContosoInsurance` database in your SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. In this task, you will create an RDP connection to the SqlServer2008 VM and then restore the `ContosoInsurance` database onto the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance using a backup provided by Contoso, Ltd.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **SqlServer2008** VM by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **SqlServer2008** VM from the list of resources.

   ![The SqlServer2008 virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/resources-sql-server-2008-vm.png "SQL Server 2008 VM")

2. On the SqlServer2008 Virtual Machine's **Overview** blade, select **Connect** on the top menu.

   ![The SqlServer2008 VM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](./media/connect-sqlserver2008.png "Connect to SqlServer2008 VM")

3. On the Connect to virtual machine blade, select **Download RDP File**, then open the downloaded RDP file.

4. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-sql-2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

   - **Username**: demouser
   - **Password**: Password.1!!

   ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials-sql-2008.png "Enter your credentials")

6. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-sqlserver2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

7. Once logged into the SqlServer2008 VM, download a [backup of the ContosoInsurance database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylebunting/MCW-App-modernization/master/Hands-on%20lab/lab-files/Database/ContosoInsurance.zip), and extract the zipped files into `C:\ContosoInsurance` on the VM.

   > TODO: Update above link to MS repo.

8. Next, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

9. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **SQLSERVER2008** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

   ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/sql-server-2008-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

10. Once connected, right-click **Databases** under SQLSERVER2008 in the Object Explorer, and then select **Attach...** from the context menu.

    ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, the context menu for Databases is displayed and Restore Database is highlighted.](media/ssms-databases-attach.png "SSMS Object Explorer")

11. You will now attach the `ContosoInsurance` database using the downloaded `ContosoInsurance.mdf` and `ContosoInsurance_log.ldf` files. On the **General** page of the Attach Databases dialog, select the **Add** button, and in the Locate Database Files dialog, expand the ContosoInsurance folder, select `ContosoInsurance.mdf`, and then select **OK**.

    ![ContosoInsurance.mdf is selected and highlighted in the Select a file box. The OK button is highlighted.](media/ssms-attach-database-source.png "Locate Database files")

12. Back on the Attach Databases dialog, verify you see the ContosoInsurance Data and Log files under database details, and then select **OK**.

    ![The completed Attach Databases dialog is displayed, with the ContosoInsurance database specified as the target.](media/ssms-attach-database.png "Attach Database")

13. You should now see the `ContosoInsurance` database listed under Databases.

    ![The ContosoInsurance database is highlighted in the list of databases.](media/ssms-databases.png "Databases")

14. Next, you will execute a script in SSMS, which will reset the `sa` password, enable mixed mode authentication, create the `WorkshopUser` account, and change the database recovery model to FULL. To create the script, open a new query window in SSMS by selecting **New Query** in the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

15. Copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window:

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    -- SET the sa password
    ALTER LOGIN [sa] WITH PASSWORD=N'Password.1!!';
    GO

    -- Enable Mixed Mode Authentication
    EXEC xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
    N'Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer', N'LoginMode', REG_DWORD, 2;
    GO

    -- Create a login and user named WorkshopUser
    CREATE LOGIN WorkshopUser WITH PASSWORD = N'Password.1!!';
    GO

    EXEC sp_addsrvrolemember
        @loginame = N'WorkshopUser',
        @rolename = N'sysadmin';
    GO

    USE ContosoInsurance;
    GO

    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = N'WorkshopUser')
    BEGIN
        CREATE USER [WorkshopUser] FOR LOGIN [WorkshopUser]
        EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_datareader', N'WorkshopUser'
    END;
    GO

    -- Update the recovery model of the database to FULL
    ALTER DATABASE ContosoInsurance SET RECOVERY FULL;
    GO
    ```

16. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

17. For Mixed Mode Authentication and the new `sa` password to take effect, you must restart the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Service on the SqlServer2008 VM. To do this, you can use SSMS. Right-click the SQLSERVER2008 instance in the SSMS Object Explorer, and then select **Restart** from the context menu.

    ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, the context menu for the SQLSERVER2008 instance is displayed, and Restart is highlighted.](media/ssms-object-explorer-restart-sqlserver2008.png "Object Explorer")

18. When prompted about restarting the MSSQLSERVER service, select **Yes**. The service will take a few seconds to restart.

    ![The Yes button is highlighted on the dialog asking if you are sure you want to restart the MSSQLSERVER service.](media/ssms-restart-service.png "Restart MSSQLSERVER service")

### Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

Contoso, Ltd. would like an assessment to see what potential issue they would have to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database. In this task, you will use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform an assessment of the `ContosoInsurance` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). The assessment will provide a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.

## Exercise 2: Post upgrade database enhancements

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise you will explore some of the security features of Azure SQL Database, and review some of the security benefits that come with running your database in Azure. [SQL Database Advance Data Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security) (ADS) provides advanced SQL security capabilities, including functionality for discovering and classifying sensitive data, surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities, and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your database.

> **NOTE**: Advanced Data Security was enabled on the database with the ARM template.

### Task 1: Configure SQL Data Discovery and Classification

In this task, you will look at the [SQL Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-data-discovery-and-classification?view=sql-server-2017) feature of Advanced Data Security. Data Discovery & Classification introduces a new tool for discovering, classifying, labeling & reporting the sensitive data in your databases. It introduces a set of advanced services, forming a new SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data in your database, not just the database. Discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (business, financial, healthcare, etc.) can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature.

> **Note**: This functionality is currently available in _Preview_ through the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **SQL database** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **ContosoInsurance** SQL database resource from the list of resources.

   ![The contosoinsurance SQL database resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/resources-azure-sql-database.png "SQL database")

2. On the SQL database blade, select **Advance Data Security** from the left-hand menu, and then select the **Data Discovery & Classification** tile.

    ![Advanced Data Security is highlighted in the menu. Data Discovery & Classification option is highlighted to select.](media/e2-03.png "Advance Data Security")

3. On the **Data Discovery & Classification** blade, select the info link with the message **We have found 7 columns with classification recommendations**.

    ![The recommendations link on the Data Discovery & Classification blade is highlighted.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-link.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

4. The classification engine scans the database and provides a list of recommended column classifications. Look over the list of recommendations to get a better understanding of the types of data and classifications are assigned, based on the built-in classification settings. In the list of classification recommendations, note the recommended classification for the **dbo - people - DOB** field (Confidential - GDPR).

    ![The DOB recommendation is highlighted in the recommendations list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-dob.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

5. ContosoInsurance is very concerned about the potential cost of any GDPR violations, and would like to label any GDPR fields as _Highly Confidential - GDPR_. To update this, select **+ Add classification** in the Data Discovery & Classification toolbar.

   ![The +Add classification button is highlighted in the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

6. In the Add classification dialog, quickly expand the **Sensitivity label** field, and review the various built-in labels you can choose from. You can also add your own labels, should you desire.

    ![The list of built-in Sensitivity labels is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-sensitivity-labels.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

7. In the Add classification dialog, enter the following:

    - **Schema name**: Select dbo.
    - **Table name**: Select people.
    - **Column name**: Select DOB (date).
    - **Information type**: Select Date Of Birth.
    - **Sensitivity level**: Select Highly Confidential - GDPR.

    ![The values specified above are entered into the Add classification dialog.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-dob-classification.png "Add classification")

8. Select **Add classification**.

9. You will see the **dbo - people - DOB** field disappear from the recommendations list, and the number of recommendations drop by 1.

10. To accept the remaining recommendations, you can check the **Select all** option and then select **Accept selected recommendations**.

    ![Classification tab on Data Discovery & Classification window showing a list of classification recommendations for ContosoInsurance database. Select all checkbox is highlighted and selected. Accept selected recommendations button is highlighted.](media/e2-05.png "Accept selected recommendations")

11. Select **Save** on the toolbar to save the changes.

    ![The Save button is highlighted on the Data Discovery & Classification toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save.png "Save")

12. When the save completes, select the **Overview** tab on the Data Discovery & Classification blade to view a report with a full summary of the database classification state.

    ![The overview dashboard is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-overview.png "Overview report")

### Task 2: Review Advanced Data Security Vulnerability Assessment

In this task, you will review an assessment report generated by ADS for the `ContosoInsurance` database. The [SQL Vulnerability Assessment service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment) is a service that provides visibility into your security state, and includes actionable steps to resolve security issues, and enhance your database security.

1. Return to the **Advanced Data Security** blade for the `ContosoInsurance` SQL database and then select the **Vulnerability Assessment** tile.

2. Navigate to **Advance Data Security** on the **Security** section of your Azure SQL Database

3. Select **Vulnerability Assessment**

    ![ContosoInsurance Azure SQL database into Azure Portal. Advanced Data Security is highlighted in the menu. Vulnerability Assessment section is highlighted](media/e2-06.png "Vulnerability Assessment")

4. On the Vulnerability Assessment blade, select **Scan** on the toolbar.

    ![Vulnerability Assessment window with Scan Option highlighted](media/e2-07.png "Scan Option")

5. When the scan completes, you will see a dashboard, displaying the number of failing checks, passing checks, and a breakdown of the risk summary by severity level.

    ![Vulnerability Assessment window with the assessment results](media/e2-08.png "Vulnerability Assessment results")

6. In the scan results, take a few minutes to browse both the Failed and Passed checks, and review the types of checks that are performed. In the **Failed** the list, locate the security check for **'dbo' user should not be used for normal service operation**. This check has an ID of **VA1143**.

    ![The VA1143 finding for 'dbo' user should not be used for normal service operation is highlighted.](media/vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1143.png "Vulnerability assessment")

7. Select the **VA1143** finding to view the detailed description.

    ![The details of the VA1143 - Transparent data encryption should be enabled finding are displayed with the description, impact, and remediation fields highlighted.](media/vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1143-details.png "Vulnerability Assessment")

    > The details for each finding provide more insight into the reason for the finding. Of note are the fields describing the finding, the impact of the recommended settings, and details on how to remediate the finding.

### Task 3: Enable Dynamic Data Masking

In this task, you will enable [Dynamic Data Masking](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking?view=sql-server-ver15) (DDM) into your Azure SQL Database to limit access to sensitive data in the database through query results. This feature helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. Itâs a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.

> For example, a service representative at a call center may identify callers by several digits of their credit card number, but those data items should not be fully exposed to the service representative. A masking rule can be defined that masks all but the last four digits of any credit card number in the result set of any query. As another example, an appropriate data mask can be defined to protect personally identifiable information (PII) data, so that a developer can query production environments for troubleshooting purposes without violating compliance regulations.

1. Return to the Overview blade of your SQL database in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and select **Dynamic Data Masking** from the left-hand menu.

    ![Dynamic Data Masking is highlighted in the left-hand menu.](media/e2-01.png "Dynamic Data Masking")

2. On the Dynamic Data Masking blade, you can see a few recommended fields to mask that have been flagged as they may contain sensitive data. For our case, we want to apply a mask to the `DOB` field on the `people` table to provide more protection to GDPR data. To do this, select **+ Add mask** in the Dynamic Data Masking toolbar.

    ![Dynamic Data Masking window with recommended fields. The +Add mask button in the toolbar is highlighted.](media/e2-02.png "Dynamic Data Masking")

3. On the Add masking rule blade, enter the following:

   - **Schema**: Select dbo.
   - **Table**: Select people.
   - **Column**: Select DOB (date).
   - **Masking field format**: Select Default value (0, xxx, 01-01-1900)
   - Select **Add**.

   ![On the Add masking rule dialog, the values specified above are entered into the form, and the Add button is highlighted.](media/ddm-add-masking-rule.png "Dynamic Data Masking")

4. Select **Save**.

   ![The Save button is highlighted on the DDM toolbar.](media/ddm-save.png "Dynamic Data Masking")

5. To view the impact of the Dynamic Data Masking, you will return to SSMS on your SqlServer2008 VM and run a few queries against the `people` table. On your SqlServer2008 VM, open SSMS and connect to the Azure SQL Database, by selecting **Connect->Database Engine** in the Object Explorer, and then entering the following into the Connect to server dialog:

    - **Server name**: Paste the server name of your Azure SQL Database, as you've done previously.
    - **Authentication type**: Select SQL Server Authentication.
    - **Username**: Enter **demouser**
    - **Password**: Enter **Password.1!!**
    - **Remember password**: Check this box.

    ![The SSMS Connect to Server dialog is displayed, with the Azure SQL Database name specified, SQL Server Authentication selected, and the demouser credentials entered.](media/ssms-connect-azure-sql-database.png "Connect to Server")

6. Select **Connect**.

7. Once connected, expand Databases, right-click the `ContosoInsurance` database and select **New Query**.

   ![In the SSMS Object explorer, the context menu for the ContosoInsurance database is displayed, and New Query is highlighted.](media/ssms-database-new-query.png "SSMS")

8. To be able to test the mask applied to the `people.DOB` field, you will need to create a user in the database that will be used for testing the masked field. This is because the `demouser` account you used to log in is a privileged user, so the mask will not be applied. In the new query window, paste the following SQL script into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE [ContosoInsurance];
   GO

   CREATE USER DDMUser WITHOUT LOGIN;
   GRANT SELECT ON [dbo].[people] TO DDMUser;
   ```

   > The SQL script above creates a new user in the database named `DDMUser`, and grants that user `SELECT` rights on the `dbo.people` table.

9. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar to run the query. You will get a message that the commands completed successfully in the Messages pane.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-execute.png "Execute")

10. With the new user created, run a quick query to observe the results. Select **New Query** again, and paste the following into the new query window.

    ```sql
    USE [ContosoInsurance];
    GO

    EXECUTE AS USER = 'DDMUser';
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[people];
    REVERT;
    ```

11. Select **Execute** from the toolbar, and examine the Results pane. Notice the `DOB` field is masked as `1900-01-01`, as defined by the mask format applied in the Azure portal.

    ![In the query results, the DOB field is highlighted, showing how all the birth dates are masked, and displaying as 1900-01-01, as defined in the mask format applied in the Azure portal.](media/ssms-masked-results.png "SSMS Query Results")

12. For comparison, run the following query in a new query window to see how the data looks when running as a privileged user.

    ```sql
    SELECT TOP 100 * FROM [dbo].[people]
    ```

    ![In the query results, the DOB field is highlighted, showing how all the birth dates appear as the actual birth date, and not a masked value.](media/ssms-unmasked-results.png "SSMS Query Results")

## Exercise 3: Configure Key Vault

Duration: 10 minutes

As part of their efforts to put tighter security controls in place, Contoso, Ltd. has asked for the application secrets to be stored in a secure manner, so they aren't visible in plain text in application configuration files. In this exercise, you will configure Azure Key Vault, which will be used to store application secrets for the Contoso web and API applications, once migrated to Azure.

### Task 1: Set Key Vault access policies

In this task, you will add an access policy to Key Vault to allow secrets to be created with your account.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Key Vault** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contosokvUNIQUE-IDENTIFIER** Key vault resource from the list of resources.

   ![The contosokv Key vault resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/azure-resources-key-vault.png "Key vault")

2. On the Key Vault blade, select **Access policies** under Settings in the left-hand menu, and then select **+ Add new**.

   ![On the Key Vault blade, Access policies is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu, and + Add new is highlighted.](media/key-vault-access-policies.png "Key Vault")

3. In the Add access policy dialog, enter the following:

   - **Configure from template (optional)**: Leave blank.
   - **Select principal**: Enter the email address of the account you are logged into the Azure portal with, select the user object that appears, and then click **Select**.
   - **Key permissions**: Leave set to 0 selected.
   - **Secret permissions**: Select this, and then select **Select All**, to give yourself full rights to manage secrets.
   - **Certificate permissions**: Leave set to 0 selected.
   - **Authorized application**: Leave set to None selected.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Add access policy dialog.](media/key-vault-add-access-policy.png "Key Vault")

4. Select **OK**.

5. Select **Save** on the Access policies toolbar.

   ![The Save button is highlighted on the Access policies toolbar.](media/key-vault-access-policies-save.png "Key Vault")

### Task 2: Create a new secret to store the SQL connection string

In this task, you will add a secret to Key Vault containing the connection string for the `ContosoInsurance` Azure SQL database.

1. First, you need to retrieve the connection string to your Azure SQL Database. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **SQL database** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **ContosoInsurance** SQL database resource from the list of resources.

   ![The contosoinsurance SQL database resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/resources-azure-sql-database.png "SQL database")

2. On the SQL database blade, select **Connection strings** from the left-hand menu, and then copy the ADO.NET connection string.

   ![Connection strings is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu on the SQL database blade, and the copy button is highlighted next to the ADO.NET connection string](media/sql-db-connection-strings.png "Connection strings")

3. Paste the copied connection string into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe. This is necessary because you will need to replace the tokenized username and password values before adding the connection string as a Secret in Key Vault.

4. In the text editor, find and replace the tokenized values as follows:

    - Replace `{your_username}` with **demouser**
    - Replace `{your_password}` with **Password.1!!**

5. Your connection string should now resemble the following:

    ```csharp
    Server=tcp:contosoinsurance-jt7yc3zphxfda.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=ContosoInsurance;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=demouser;Password=Password.1!!;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;
    ```

6. Copy your updated connection string from the text editor.

7. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Key Vault** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contosokvUNIQUE-IDENTIFIER** Key vault resource from the list of resources.

   ![The contosokv Key vault resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/azure-resources-key-vault.png "Key vault")

8. On the Key Vault blade, select **Secrets** under Settings in the left-hand menu, and then select **+ Generate/Import**.

    ![On the Key Vault blade, Secrets is selected and the +Generate/Import button is highlighted.](media/e3-03.png "Key Vault Secrets")

9. On the Create a secret blade, enter the following:

    - **Upload options**: Select Manual.
    - **Name**: Enter **SqlConnectionString**
    - **Value**: Paste the updated SQL connection string you copied from the text editor.

    ![On the Create a secret blade, the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](media/e3-04.png "Create a secret")

10. Select **Create**.

11. When the secret has been created successfully, select it from the list of secrets on the Secrets blade.

    ![The SqlConnectionString is highlighted on the Key Vault Secrets blade.](media/e3-05.png "Key Vault Secrets")

12. On the SqlConnectionString secret blade, select the Current Version, copy the Secret Identifier from the Secret Version blade, and paste it into a text editor for later reference.

    ![On the Secret version blade for the SqlConnectionString secret, the Secret identifier is highlighted.](media/e3-06.png "SqlConnectionString secret version")

13. The Secret Identifier will look like:

    ```http
    https://contosokvjt7yc3zphxfda.vault.azure.net/secrets/SqlConnectionString/55b88481a2ba4b03bb1c9f0f09b3f55be
    ```

14. This is the version specific identifier. You can omit the version number to always obtain the latest version of the secret. For example:

    ```http
    https://contosoinsurancekeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/SqlConnectionString/
    ```

### Task 3: Create service principal for the web app using Azure CLI and grant access to Key Vault

> TODO: Reword the below, and possibly change the task title. Not sure what exactly this is supposed to be doing, but instructions need to be made much more clear.

In this task you will provide the managed identity of your API App in order to use this identity to authenticate any service that can use Azure AD without having any credentials on the code.

> TODO: Come back to this once the apps are set up, and I can figure out what the hell they were trying to do here. In order for the below `az` commands to work, you would first need to enable managed identities on the API app by selecting **Identity** on the left-hand menu, and then switching the Status to On. Question is whether it would be easier to just create a Service Principal that could be shared by the various apps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the Azure Cloud Shell icon from the top menu.

    ![The Azure Cloud Shell icon is highlighted in the Azure portal's top menu.](media/cloud-shell-icon.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

2. In the Cloud Shell window that opens at the bottom of your browser window, select **PowerShell**.

    ![In the Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell window, PowerShell is highlighted.](media/cloud-shell-select-powershell.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

3. After a moment, you will receive a message that you have successfully requested a Cloud Shell, and be presented with a PS Azure prompt.

    ![In the Azure Cloud Shell dialog, a message is displayed that requesting a Cloud Shell succeeded, and the PS Azure prompt is displayed.](media/cloud-shell-ps-azure-prompt.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

4. At the prompt, run the following command to create the identity for your Web Api Application. Replace your Web Api Name and Resource Group. **IMPORTANT**: Replace 

   ```powershell
   az webapp identity assign --name "<your-api-resource-name>" --resource-group "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX"
   ```

4. Copy the `PrincipalId` that you will get as output from the CLI, you will need it in the next step.

    ![In the Image the output of the identity creation list a value for the PrincipalId.](media/e3-t2-cli-identity-output.png "Azure CLI")

4. Run the following command to assign permissions to your application to read Secrets from the Key Vault. Replace your Key Vault Service name and principalId from the last step.

```Azure CLI
az keyvault set-policy --name "ContosoInsuranceKeyVaultSUFFIX" --object-id "PrincipalId" --secret-permissions get list
```
> Replace <PrincipalId> with the identifier you copied in the previous step.

5. You can check the permissions you assigned to the Key Vault by selecting the **Access policies** option under the **Settings** section.

    ![On the Secret version blade for the SqlConnectionString secret, the Secret identifier is highlighted.](media/e3-07.png "SqlConnectionString secret version")

## Exercise 4: Migrate web and API apps into App Services

Duration: 30 minutes

The developers at Contoso, Ltd. have been working toward migrating their apps to the cloud. As such, most of the pieces are already in place to deploy the apps to Azure, as well as configure them to communicate with the new app services, such as Web API. Since the required services have already been provisioned in, what remains is applying application-level configuration settings, and then deploying any hosted apps and services from the Visual Studio starter project solution. In this task, you will apply application settings to the Web API using the Azure Portal. Once the application settings have been set, you will deploy the Web API from the Visual Studio.

## Exercise 5: Upload policy documents into blob storage

Duration: 10 minutes.

Contoso, Ltd. is currently storing all of their scanned PDF documents on a shared local network. They have asked to be able to store them in the cloud automatically from a workflow. In this exercise, you will provide a storage account that will be used to store the files in a blob container. Then, you will provide a way to bulk upload their existing PDFs.

### Task 1: Create container for storing PDFs in Azure storage

In this task, you will create a new container in your storage account for the scanned PDF policy documents.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Storage account** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contosoUNIQUE-IDENTIFIER** Storage account resource from the list of resources.

    ![The Storage Account resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/e5-01.png "Storage account")

2. From the Storage account Overview blade, select **Blobs** under services.

    ![Blobs is selected on the Overview blade of the Storage account.](media/e5-02.png "Storage account")

3. On the Blob service blade, select **+ Container** to create a new container.

4. In the New container dialog, enter "policies" as the container name, set the Public access level to **Container**, and then select **OK**.

    ![The New container dialog is displayed with a name of \"policies\" entered, and the Public access level set to Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs).](media/e5-03.png "Blob service")

    > **IMPORTANT** Setting the Public access level to Container is for demo purposes. Otherwise, you should set this to Private.

5. After the container has been created, select its name on the Blob service blade, select Properties, and copy the URL from the policies -- Properties blade. Paste it into a text editor for later reference.

    ![The policies container is selected, with the Properties blade selected, and the URL of the storage container highlighted.](media/e5-04.png "Blob server properties")

### Task 2: Bulk upload PDFs to blob storage using AzCopy

In this task, you will download and install [AzCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy). You will then use AzCopy to copy the PDF files from the "on-premises" location into the policies container in Azure storage.

1. On your LabVM, open a web browser and download the latest version of AzCopy from <https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy>.

2. Run the downloaded installer, accepting the license agreement and all the defaults, to complete the AzCopy install.

3. Next you will retrieve the access key for your storage account, which you will need to provide to AzCopy to connect to your storage container. On your Storage account blade in the Azure portal, select **Access keys** from the left-hand menu,and copy the **key1 Key** value to a text editor for use below.

    ![Access Keys is selected on the Storage account. On the blade, access keys and buttons to copy are displayed](media/e5-05.png "Access Keys")

4. Back on the LabVM, launch a Command Prompt window (Select search on the task bar, type **cmd**, and select Enter).

5. At the Command prompt, change the directory to the AzCopy directory. By default, it is installed to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy` (On a 32-bit machine, change `Program Files (x86)` to `Program Files` ). You can do this by running the command:

   ```bash
   cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy
   ```

6. Type the following command in the command prompt, replacing the tokenized values with your own:

   ```bash
   AzCopy /Source:"[FILE-SOURCE]" /Dest:"[STORAGE-CONTAINER-URL]" /DestKey:"[STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY]" /S
   ```

7. The values in the above command should be replaced as follows:

   - `[FILE-SOURCE]`: This is the path to the `policy-documents` folder your downloaded copy of the GitHub repo. If you used the extraction path of `C:\MCW`, the path will be `C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\policy-documents`.
   - `[STORAGE-CONTAINER-URL]`: This is the URL to your storage account's policies container, which you copied in the last step of the previous task. (e.g., <https://contosojt7yc3zphxfda.blob.core.windows.net/policies>)
   - `[STORAGE-ACCOUNT-KEY]`: This is the blob storage account key you copied previously in this task. (e.g., `eqgxGSnCiConfgshXQ1rFwBO+TtCH6sduekk6s8PxPBxHWOmFumycTeOlL3myb8eg4Ba2dn7rtdHnk/1pi6P/w==`)

8. The final command should resemble the following:

    ```bash
    AzCopy /Source:"C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\policy-documents" /Dest:"https://contosojt7yc3zphxfda.blob.core.windows.net/policies" /DestKey:"XJT3us2KT1WQHAQBbeotrRCWQLZayFDNmhLHt3vl2miKOHeXasB7IUlw2+y4afH6R/03wbTiRK9SRqGXt9JVqQ==" /S
    ```

9. In the output of the command, you should see that 650 files were transferred successfully.

    ![The output of the AzCopy command is displayed.](media/e5-06.png "AzCopy output")

10. You can verify the upload by navigating to the policies container in your Azure Storage account.

    ![The policies Container with the Overview blade selected shows the list of uploaded files.](media/e5-07.png "Policies Container")

## Exercise 6: Create serverless API for accessing PDFs

Duration: 15 minutes

Contoso, Ltd. has made some updates to prepare their applications, but there are some features that they have not been able to build into the API yet. They have requested that you assist them in setting up a proof-of-concept (POC) API solution to enable users of their application to retrieve their policy documents directly from their Azure Storage account. In this exercise, you will create an Azure Functions Proxy within your Function App to enable this functionality using serverless technologies.

### Task 1: Retrieve URL for a policy document in Azure storage

In this task, you will retrieve the URL associated with one of the PDF policy documents you uploaded into Azure storage in the previous exercise.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Storage account** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contosoUNIQUE-IDENTIFIER** Storage account resource from the list of resources.

   ![The Storage Account resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/e5-01.png "Storage account")

2. From the Storage account Overview blade, select **Blobs** under services.

   ![Blobs is selected on the Overview blade of the Storage account.](media/e5-02.png "Storage account")

3. On the Blobs blade, select the **policies** container.

   ![Azure Storage container blobs screen with policies container highlighted to select](media/e6-05.png "Azure storage container selection")

4. On the Overview page of the policies blade, select the first document in the list.

   ![The policies storage container Overview blade is displayed, with the first blob selected from the list.](media/e6-06.png "Policies storage container")

5. On the selected blob, select the **Click to copy** button next to the **URL** to copy the URL for the blob, and paste it into a text editor for use below.

   ![The URL of the selected blob is highlighted on its properties page.](media/e6-07.png "Blob properties")

### Task 2: Create an Azure Functions Proxy

In this task, you will create an Azure Function Proxy, which is a simple way to provide a clean API endpoint. To learn more, check out [Working with Azure Functions Proxies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-proxies).

1. Navigate to your Function App in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contosoinsfuncUNIQUE-IDENTIFIER** App Service resource from the list of resources.

    ![The Function App resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/azure-resources-function-app.png "Storage account")

2. On the Function Apps blade, select **+** next to **Proxies** under the contosoinsfuncUNIQUE-IDENTIFIER Function App.

    ![The + button is highlighted next to Proxies on the Function App screen.](media/e6-08.png "Azure Function App")

3. In the New proxy form, enter the following values:

    - **Name**: PolicyDocs
    - **Route template**: Enter "/"
    - **Allowed HTTP methods**: Choose Selected Methods and check *GET*.
    - **Backend URL**: Paste the policy document URL you copied in the previous task.

    ![On the New proxy blade, the values specified above are entered into the form.](media/e6-09.png "Function App Proxies")

4. Select **Create**.

5. When it is done creating the Proxy, copy the Proxy URL, and paste it into a new browser tab or window.

    ![The copy button for the Proxy URL is highlighted.](media/e6-10.png "PolicyDocs Proxy properties")

6. This will result in the policy document being downloaded. You can open the downloaded file and inspect the policy document.

### Task 3: Parameterize Azure Functions Proxy

In the previous task, you created an Azure Functions Proxy to download a specific policy document from Azure storage. In this task, you will update the Proxy to parameterize the URL, so you can retrieve any policy document using the policy holder's last name and their policy number.

1. Return to the PolicyDocs Proxy in your Function App in the Azure portal.

2. Update the Route template and Backend URL fields with the following values:

   - **Route template**: Change to "/{policyHolder}/{policyNumber}".
   - **Backend URL**: Change to "`https://\<YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-NAME\>.blob.core.windows.net/policies/{policyHolder}-{policyNumber}.pdf`.

   ![On the Proxy blade, the route template and backend URL values are updated, as specified above".](media/e6-11.png "PolicyDocs Proxy properties")

3. Select **Save** on the Proxy toolbar.

   ![The Save button is highlighted on the Functions Proxy toolbar.](media/functions-proxy-save.png "Save")

4. Copy the new Proxy URL and paste it into a new browser tab or window and replace the parameters in the URL with a policy holder's last name and policy number. For example:

   - {policyHolder}: Acevedo
   - {policyNumber}: ACE5605VZZ2ACQ
   - <https://[your-function-app-name].azurewebsites.net/Acevedo/ACE5605VZZ2ACQ>

   > You can try this out with other policy holder names and numbers, such as setting policyHolder to "Barker" and policyNumber to "BAR3840E87YCGX", to see how the parameterized URL allows you to target specific policy documents.

5. The Azure Functions Proxy is now ready for use within the Contoso, Ltd. applications.

## Exercise 7: Add Cognitive Search for policy documents

Duration: 15 minutes

Contoso, Ltd. has asked for the ability to conduct full-text searching on their policy documents. Previously, they have not been able to extract information from the documents in a usable way, but they have read about about [cognitive search with Azure Search Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-intro), and are interested to learn if they can be used to make the data in their search index more useful. In this exercise, you will provision an Azure Search service, then configure search indexing on the policies blob storage container.

### Task 1: Add Azure Search to Blob Storage account

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Storage account** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from the left-hand navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contosoUNIQUE-IDENTIFIER** Storage account resource from the list of resources.
