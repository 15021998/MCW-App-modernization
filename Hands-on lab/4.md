## Exercise 4: Setup CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for the web app

Duration: 55 minutes

In this exercise, you will move the codebase to a GitHub Repo, create a staging environment in Azure App Service using App Service Deployment Slots, and finally connect the pieces with a CI/CD Pipeline built on GitHub Actions.

### Task 1: Moving the codebase to a GitHub repo

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com) with your account. Select the New button positioned on top of the repositories list. As an alternative, you can [navigate to the new repository site here](https://github.com/new).

    ![GitHub.com Landing page is shown. New button to create a new repository is highlighted.](media/github-new-repo.png "GitHub new repo")

2. Type in `partsunlimited` **(1)** as your repository name. Select **Private (2)** to prevent public access to the repository. Select **Create repository (3)** to continue.

    ![Repository name is set to partsunlimited. Private access is selected. Create repository button is highlighted.](media/github-partsunlimited-repo.png "Create a new repository")

3. Select the **clipboard copy command** to copy the Git endpoint for your repository and paste the value into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, for later reference.

    ![GitHub repository page is shown. Endpoint copy to clipboard button is highlighted.](media/github-endpoint-copy.png "Repository endpoint")

    So far, we have used the WebVM virtual machine to simulate Parts Unlimited's On-Premises IIS server. Now that we are done with the migration of Parts Unlimited's website. We will use the VM to execute some development tasks.

4. Connect to your WebVM VM with RDP.

   ![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/webvm-selection.png "WebVM Selection")

5. Right-click on the Windows Start Menu and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** to launch a terminal window.

    ![Start Menu context menu is open. Windows PowerShell (Admin) command is highlighted.](media/launch-powershell.png "Windows PowerShell")

6. The Parts Unlimited website's source code is already copied into the VM as part of the **Before the hands-on lab exercises**. Run the command below to navigate to the source code folder.

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\MCW\MCW-App-modernization-stage-2\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src"
    ```

7. Run the following command to initialize a local Git repository.

    ```powershell
    git init
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git init is highlighted and executed.](media/git-init.png "Git init")

8. Next, we will define the remote endpoint as an origin to our local repository. Replace `{YourEndpointURL}` with the endpoint URL you copied previously from GitHub. Run the final command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git remote add origin {YourEndpointURL}
    ```

    ![PowerShell terminal is shown. Git remote add origin is highlighted and executed. ](media/git-remote-add.png "Git remote add")

9. Run the following commands to rename the current branch to **Main** and stage all the files for a git commit.

    ```powershell
    git branch -M main
    git add .
    ```

10. Before we commit our changes, we have to identify our git user name and e-mail. In the following command, replace `John Doe` with your name and `johndoe@example.com` with your e-mail address. Once ready, run the command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```

11. We are ready to commit the source code to our local Git repository. Run the following command to continue.

    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    ```

12. Let's push our code to GitHub. Run the following command in your PowerShell terminal.

    ```powershell
    git push -u origin main
    ```

13. GitHub authentication screen will pop up. Select **Sign in with your browser (2)**. A new browser pop-up will appear with the GitHub login page.

    ![PowerShell terminal shows git push command and the GitHub Sign In experoence. Sign in with your browser button is highlighted.](media/github-sign-in.png "GitHub Sign In")

14. Fill-in your GitHub account credentials on the browser window to Sign-In.

15. On the **Authorize Git Credential Manager** screen, select **Authorize GotCredentialManager**. This will give your local environment permission to push the code to GitHub.

    ![Authorize Git Credential Manager is open. Authorize GotCredentialManager button is highlighted.](media/github-access.png "Authorize Git Credential Manager")

16. Close the browser.

17. Go back to GitHub and observe the repository with the source code uploaded.

8. Open the **Views and more actions... (1)** menu and select **Push (2)** to push the changes to GitHub.

    ![Views and more actions... menu is open. Push command is highlighted.](media/vscode-push.png "GitHub Push")

9. Open the GitHub repository and observe the Actions page for the latest execution of the CI/CD Pipeline.

    ![PartsUnlimited repo is open. Actions page is shown. Successful CI/CD run for the new home page title is highlighted.](media/github-actions-success-commit.png "New commit build")

10. Navigate to the staging environment endpoint in your browser and observe the Title change.

    ![Parts Unlimited staging environment is open in a browser. New Home Page title is highlighted.](media/staging-code-changes.png "Parts Unlimited Staging Web Site")

Now that Parts Unlimited has a separate staging environment for their e-commerce site, they can push new source code and functionality to the repo that will automatically be built and deployed to their staging for testing.

### Task 5: Swap deployment slots to move changes in staging to production

Once Parts Unlimited is happy with the changes tested in their staging environment, they can swap the two environments and have changes go to production. Environment Swap happens very fast and can help Parts Unlimited pull back changes by switching back if needed.

1. Go back to your lab resource group, navigate to your `partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}` **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `partsunlimited-web` **(1)** to find your app service.

   ![The search box for resources is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/resource-group-appservice-resource.png "Resources")

2. Switch to the **Deployment slots (1)** tab and select **Swap (2)**.

    ![App Service Deployment Slots tab is open. Swap button highlighted.](media/app-service-slot-swap.png "Deployment Slot Swap")

3. Select the **Swap** button to swap the staging slot with the production slow.

    ![Deployment Slot Swap dialog is open. Swap button is highlighted.](media/app-service-slot-swap-panel.png "Deployment Slot Swap")

4. Once you receive the success message, close the swap panel.

5. Visit both production and staging slot endpoints and observe how the Title change is moved to production.

    > Once you move your staging slot to production, your production slot is moved to staging as well. This means that your current staging slot does not have the latest changes you have pushed to the repo. You can trigger a manual CI/CD workflow execution to push the latest changes to staging.
    >
    > To run a CI/CD workflow manually, go to GitHub actions page **(1)** in your repository. Select the workflow **(2)** to run. Open the **Run workflow (3)** menu and select **Run workflow (4)**.
    >
    > ![GitHub Actions page is shown. Build and deploy ASP.Net Core app to Azure Web App - partsunlimited-web-20(staging) workflow is selected. Run workflow menu is open. Run workflow button is highlighted.](media/github-actions-manual-run.png "Manual workflow run")
